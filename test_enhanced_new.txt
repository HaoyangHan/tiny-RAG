# Test Document with Enhanced Processing

This is a test document to verify enhanced processing capabilities.

## Sample Table Data

| Bob      | 25  | Marketing  |
| Charlie  | 35  | Sales      |

## Text Content
This document contains mixed content including text, tables, and would normally include images in a real PDF.

The enhanced processor should:
1. Extract and summarize tables
2. Process any images with GPT-4 Vision
3. Create appropriate chunks for each content type
4. Generate embeddings for semantic search
