## Usage Questions

### How do I upload documents?
1. Log in to the platform
2. Navigate to the document upload section
3. Select your PDF file
4. Wait for processing to complete

### How long does document processing take?
- Small documents (< 10 pages): ~30 seconds
- Medium documents (10-50 pages): 1-2 minutes
- Large documents (> 50 pages): 2-5 minutes

### How do I customize the memo generation?
1. Select a base prompt template
2. Modify the prompt parameters
3. Add specific instructions
4. Generate the memo

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Document Upload Fails
1. Check file size (max 10MB)
2. Verify PDF format
3. Ensure stable internet connection
4. Check browser console for errors

#### Generation Takes Too Long
1. Check document size
2. Verify server status
3. Check network connection
4. Contact support if persistent

#### Citations Not Working
1. Verify document processing completed
2. Check document format
3. Try regenerating the memo
4. Report issue if persistent

### Error Messages

#### "Document Processing Failed"
- Cause: Corrupted PDF or unsupported format
- Solution: Verify PDF integrity, try different file

#### "Generation Timeout"
- Cause: Large document or server load
- Solution: Try smaller document, wait and retry

#### "Authentication Error"
- Cause: Invalid credentials or expired session
- Solution: Log out and log in again
