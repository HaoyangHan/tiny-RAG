   - *Mitigation*: Phased implementation with fallback to v1.1 functionality

2. **Performance Impact**
   - *Risk*: Core library abstraction overhead
   - *Mitigation*: Performance testing and optimization in each phase

3. **Dependency Management**
   - *Risk*: Version conflicts between frameworks
   - *Mitigation*: Careful dependency pinning and testing

### Operational Risks
1. **Migration Complexity**
   - *Risk*: Breaking changes during migration
   - *Mitigation*: Backward compatibility maintenance and gradual migration

2. **Testing Coverage**
   - *Risk*: Insufficient testing of new features
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage target

## Migration Strategy

### From v1.1 to v1.2
1. **Phase 1**: Core library setup without breaking existing functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Gradual service migration with feature flags
3. **Phase 3**: Frontend updates to support new capabilities
4. **Phase 4**: Full deployment with monitoring and rollback capability

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain all v1.1 API endpoints
- Preserve existing LLM factory functionality
- Support gradual feature adoption
- Provide migration documentation and tools

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- **Type Hints**: All functions and methods must have type annotations
- **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings for all public APIs
- **Testing**: Minimum 90% test coverage
- **Linting**: Ruff for code formatting and style checking
- **Performance**: Response time and memory usage monitoring

### Architecture Principles
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, dependency inversion
- **DRY**: Don't repeat yourself - shared code in core library
- **KISS**: Keep it simple - avoid over-engineering
- **Factory Pattern**: Service instantiation through factories
- **Abstract Interfaces**: Pluggable service implementations
