# UI/UX Development Guide: AI-Assisted Document Drafting Flow

## 1. Overview and Status

*   **Page Summary:** This guide outlines a multi-step user flow for creating a new data-driven document, referred to as a "Credit Memo". The flow enables users to define a project, upload source documents, and then utilize an AI-generated draft in a side-by-side editor to author the final document.
*   **User Flow Location:** This is a core feature flow, likely initiated from a "Create New" button on a main dashboard or project list page after the user has logged in. The flow consists of three primary stages:
    1.  **Project Detail:** User creates a new project by providing a name and identifier.
    2.  **Document Upload:** User uploads source files (e.g., PDF, DOCX) that will be used for AI generation.
    3.  **Drafting:** User interacts with a multi-panel editor to review an AI-generated draft, write their own narrative, verify content against retrieved data chunks, and complete the document.
*   **Key Functionality:**
    *   Create a new project.
    *   Upload and manage source documents.
    *   View an AI-generated draft based on uploaded documents.
    *   Edit and author a user-written draft in a rich text editor.
    *   Review retrieved text chunks from source documents.
    *   Verify the draft against a predefined guidance checklist.
    *   Save progress and manage the draft's status.

## 2. Style Guide

*   **Typography:**
    *   **Heading 1 (Page Title):** Sans-serif, Semi-Bold, ~24px, `#343A40`

## 3. Page Layout and Component Breakdown

### 3.1. High-Level Layout
The application maintains a consistent layout throughout the flow.
*   **Header:** Contains the "Primary Brand Logo", platform name, primary navigation links ("Home", "My document", "All document"), and a user profile avatar/menu.
*   **Left Sidebar:** Displays the user's progress through the flow.
    *   **`Project Progress` Stepper:** A vertical stepper indicating the current stage (`Project Detail`, `Document Upload`, `Drafting`).
    *   **`Project Sections` Navigation:** A list of anchor links that navigate the user within the main `Drafting` view. This is only visible in the final step.
*   **Main Content Area:** A large container to the right of the sidebar where the content for each step is rendered.
*   **Footer (within Main Content):** A persistent bar at the bottom of the main content area with "Back" and "Next"/"Submit" buttons for navigation.

### 3.2. Component Details
*   **Component: `ProjectCreationForm` (Step 1)**
    *   **Description:** A simple form within a centered card for initiating the project.
    *   **Elements:**
        *   Card Title: "Create a New Project".
        *   Input Field: "Project Name" (Text input).
        *   Input Field: "GFCID" (Text input with a search icon).
        *   Informational Callout: A light blue box with details on data restrictions.
        *   Action Buttons: "Back", "Submit".
    *   **State:** The "Submit" button is disabled until required fields are filled.

*   **Component: `FileUploadManager` (Step 2)**
    *   **Description:** A component for uploading and listing source documents.
    *   **Elements:**
        *   `FileUploadZone`: A dashed-border dropzone for dragging and dropping files, also includes a "Select File(s)" button.
        *   `InstructionsPanel`: A panel with text explaining the upload process and data confidentiality rules.
        *   `DocumentsTable`: A table to display uploaded files.
    *   **`DocumentsTable` Columns:** Name, Type, Uploaded, Status, Document Type (Dropdown), Published Date, Actions (Download, Delete icons).
    *   **State:**
        *   **Empty State:** Table shows "No documents selected".
        *   **Populated State:** Table lists successfully uploaded files. Status shows as "Completed". The "Next" button in the footer becomes enabled.

*   **Component: `LoadingState` (Between Steps 2 and 3)**
    *   **Description:** A full-panel loading indicator shown after documents are submitted for processing.
    *   **Elements:** A centered spinning loader icon with text below: "The Elements are Generating. Please wait a few moments while the documents are generated for your draft and guidance verification."

*   **Component: `DraftingInterface` (Step 3)**
    *   **Description:** A complex, multi-panel workspace for creating the document.
    *   **Elements:**
        *   **`AIGeneratedDraft` Panel:** A read-only view displaying the AI-generated text. Includes pagination controls at the bottom.
        *   **`UserDraft` Panel:** The main workspace for the user. Contains a rich text editor with standard formatting controls (Bold, Italic, Underline, Lists).

        *   Text Area: A multi-line input for the reason.
        *   Action Buttons: "Not Now", "Yes".

## 4. Frontend Implementation Plan (React/Vue/Svelte)

*   **Suggested Component Architecture:**
    *   `pages/projects/create/[step].js`: A dynamic route to handle the multi-step flow. The `step` parameter (`detail`, `upload`, `draft`) determines which main component to render.
    *   `components/layout/AppLayout.js`: A wrapper component including the `Header` and `LeftSidebar`.
    *   `components/steppers/ProjectProgressStepper.js`: Props: `currentStep`.
    *   `components/forms/ProjectCreationForm.js`: Props: `onSubmit`.
    *   `components/upload/FileUploadManager.js`: Manages upload logic and displays `DocumentsTable`. Props: `projectId`, `onComplete`.
    *   `components/drafting/DraftingInterface.js`: The main container for the drafting step. Manages the state and layout of its child panels. Props: `projectId`.
    *   `components/common/ConfirmationModal.js`: Reusable modal component. Props: `isOpen`, `onConfirm`, `onCancel`, `title`, `children`.
*   **State Management:**
    *   **Server State:** Use a library like **React Query** or **SWR** to manage fetching, caching, and mutation of all backend data (projects, documents, generations). This will handle loading and error states automatically.
    *   **Global Client State:** Use **Zustand** or **Context API** to store the `projectId` and other details of the in-progress creation flow, making it accessible across all steps.
    *   **Local State:** Use `useState` for simple form inputs and UI state within individual components (e.g., active tab in the chunks panel).
*   **Logic:**
    1.  The `ProjectCreationForm` component's `onSubmit` handler will fire a mutation to `POST /projects`. On success, it will store the new `project.id` in the global state and navigate the user to the `upload` step.
    2.  The `FileUploadManager` will use the `projectId` from the global state to make `POST /documents/upload` requests for each file. It will poll or use WebSockets to update the `DocumentsTable` by re-fetching `GET /projects/{project_id}/documents`.
    3.  After files are uploaded, clicking "Next" might trigger a backend process to create and execute an "element". The UI should navigate to the `draft` step and show the `LoadingState` component while polling a generation status endpoint (e.g., `GET /generations/{generation_id}`).
    4.  Once generation is complete, the `DraftingInterface` will fetch all necessary data: the generation result (`GET /generations/{id}`), document chunks (`GET /documents/{id}/content`), and project details (`GET /projects/{id}`).

## 5. Related Backend API Integration

*   **Project Creation (Step 1):**
    *   **UI Component:** `ProjectCreationForm`
    *   **Backend API Endpoint:** `POST /projects`
    *   **Description:** Submitting the form creates a new project record. The form's "Project Name" maps to the `name` field in the request body.

*   **Document Upload (Step 2):**
    *   **UI Component:** `FileUploadManager`
    *   **Backend API Endpoint:** `POST /documents/upload`
    *   **Description:** Each file is uploaded as multipart form data. The `project_id` must be passed as a query parameter.

*   **List Uploaded Documents (Step 2):**
    *   **UI Component:** `DocumentsTable`
    *   **Backend API Endpoint:** `GET /projects/{project_id}/documents`
    *   **Description:** Fetches the list of all documents associated with the current project to populate the table. The `status` field from the response (`PROCESSED`) maps to the "Completed" status in the UI.

*   **AI Content Generation (Step 3 - Loading):**
    *   **UI Component:** `LoadingState` (triggered after Step 2)
    *   **Backend API Endpoint:** `POST /elements` followed by `POST /elements/{element_id}/execute`
    *   **Description:** The frontend likely initiates the creation of a prompt template (`element`) and then executes it. The UI polls the status of this execution. The response from the execution endpoint contains the `generation_id`.

*   **Fetch Draft Data (Step 3 - Drafting):**
    *   **UI Component:** `DraftingInterface`
    *   **Backend API Endpoints:**
        *   `GET /generations/{generation_id}`: To fetch the "AI Generated Draft" content from the `content` field.
        *   `GET /documents/{document_id}/content`: To fetch the `chunks` array for the "Retrieved Chunks" panel.
    *   **Description:** On load, the drafting interface makes multiple API calls to populate its various panels with the AI-generated draft and the source document chunks.

*   **Update Project Status (Modal):**
    *   **UI Component:** `StatusConfirmationModal`
    *   **Backend API Endpoint:** `PUT /projects/{project_id}`
    *   **Description:** Submitting the confirmation modal updates the project's status. The request body would contain the new `status` and potentially other fields. The `reason` from the textarea would need to be added to the project's `description` or a custom metadata field.
