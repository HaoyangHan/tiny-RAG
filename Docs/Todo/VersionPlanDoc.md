## Version 1.3 - 🚧 IN PROGRESS
**Focus:** Advanced RAG capabilities, authentication, and core library development

### Core Objectives

#### 1. **Authentication & Authorization System** 🔐
- **API Security:**
  - JWT-based authentication
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - API key management for different access levels
  - Rate limiting and usage quotas
- **User Management:**
  - User registration and login endpoints
  - Session management
  - Password security (hashing, validation)
  - User profile management

#### 2. **UI-API Integration** 🔗
- **Frontend Authentication:**
  - Login/logout functionality
  - Token management and refresh
  - Protected routes and components
- **RAG Workflow Integration:**
  - Document upload with real API calls
  - Embedding generation and storage
  - Advanced retrieval with metadata filtering
  - Generation with streaming responses
  - Real-time status updates

#### 3. **Advanced RAG Core Library (`rag-memo-core-lib`)** 🧠
- **Metadata Extraction Framework:**
  - Date extractor for temporal information
  - Keyword extractor for topic identification
  - Summarization extractor for content overview
  - Entity extractor for named entities
  - Custom metadata schema definitions
- **Advanced Retrieval Strategies:**
  - Metadata-enhanced retrieval
  - Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
  - Custom reranking algorithms
  - Context-aware chunk selection
- **Reranking & Generation:**
  - Customizable reranker with metadata scoring
  - Multi-stage retrieval pipeline
  - Citation-aware generation
  - Quality assessment metrics

### Technical Architecture

#### Authentication Flow
```
User → Frontend → API Gateway → JWT Validation → Protected Resources
     ←          ←             ← Token Response ←
```

#### RAG Pipeline Enhancement
```
Document → Parsing → Metadata Extraction → Chunking → Embedding → Storage
                                     ↓
Query → Retrieval → Metadata Filtering → Reranking → Generation → Response
```

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Authentication Foundation (Week 1)
- Implement JWT authentication in `rag-memo-api`
- Create user management endpoints
- Add authentication middleware
- Set up rate limiting

#### Phase 2: Core Library Development (Week 2)
- Build metadata extraction framework in `rag-memo-core-lib`
- Implement date, keyword, and summarization extractors
- Create custom reranker with metadata scoring
- Add comprehensive unit tests

#### Phase 3: UI Integration (Week 3)
- Implement authentication UI components
- Connect document upload to real API
- Add real-time RAG workflow visualization
- Implement streaming response handling

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
- Deploy hybrid search capabilities
- Add metadata-based filtering in UI
- Implement custom reranking strategies
- Performance optimization and monitoring

### Development Standards
Following `.cursorrules` requirements:
- **Code Quality:** Type annotations, comprehensive docstrings, 90% test coverage
- **Architecture:** SOLID principles, modular design, clean interfaces
- **Security:** Input validation, authentication, authorization
- **Performance:** Async operations, caching, efficient algorithms
- **Documentation:** API docs, user guides, development setup

### Success Metrics
1. **Authentication:**
   - Secure user registration/login flow
   - Proper JWT token management
   - Role-based access control working

2. **RAG Enhancement:**
   - Metadata extraction accuracy > 85%
   - Retrieval relevance improvement > 20%
   - Generation quality with proper citations

3. **Integration:**
   - End-to-end RAG workflow functional
   - Real-time updates and status tracking
   - Error handling and user feedback

### Next Steps: Version 1.4
- Multi-document analysis capabilities
- Advanced prompt engineering
- Vector database optimization
- Production deployment strategy
- Monitoring and analytics dashboard
