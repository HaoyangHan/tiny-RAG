# Version 1.0 - TinyRAG MVP

## Overview
Version 1.0 focuses on delivering the core value proposition: generating memos from PDFs with basic functionality and essential features.

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend (`rag-memo-ui`)
- **Technology Stack:**
  - React/Vue.js with TypeScript
  - Vite for build tooling
  - TailwindCSS for styling
- **Key Features:**
  - User authentication
  - Single PDF upload interface
  - Basic prompt selection
  - Memo display with text citations
  - Simple status polling for generation

### 2. Backend API (`rag-memo-api`)
- **Technology Stack:**
  - FastAPI with Python 3.11+
  - Pydantic for data validation
  - Dramatiq with Redis for async processing
- **Core Endpoints:**
  - `/documents/upload` - PDF upload endpoint
  - `/generate` - Memo generation endpoint
  - `/generations/{generation_id}` - Status and result retrieval
  - Basic CRUD for projects and elements

### 3. Core Services
- **Document Parsing Service:**
  - PDF text extraction
  - Basic metadata extraction
- **RAG Engine:**
  - Text chunking
  - Vector embeddings

## Success Metrics
1. **Functionality:**
   - Successful PDF processing
   - Accurate memo generation
   - Working citation system

2. **Performance:**
   - Document processing time < 30 seconds
   - Memo generation time < 60 seconds
   - API response time < 200ms

3. **Quality:**
   - 90% of generated memos require only minor edits
   - Citations accurately link to source material
