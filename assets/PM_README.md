## **Product Brief: "TinyRAG" - The Intelligent Memo Generation Platform**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** GenAI Architecture & Product Team
**Status:** For Review & Approval

### 1. The Elevator Pitch

**For** internal financial analysts, legal teams, and executive staff **who** currently spend countless hours manually drafting memos from dense, complex documents, **TinyRAG** is an intelligent AI-powered platform that automates the creation of first-draft memos. **Unlike** manual processes or generic AI chatbots, **our product** uses cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure every statement is grounded in the user's specific source documents, complete with verifiable citations. This drastically reduces drafting time, improves accuracy, and ensures consistency across the organization.

### 2. The Problem: The High Cost of Manual Memo Generation

In a fast-paced financial institution, the creation of internal memos—summarizing risks, analyzing earnings calls, or reviewing legal filings—is a critical but inefficient process. The current workflow suffers from several key pain points:

*   **Time-Consuming:** Analysts spend 5-10 hours per week, or even more, sifting through hundreds of pages of PDFs, transcripts, and reports to synthesize key information.
*   **Error-Prone:** Manual data extraction and summarization can lead to missed details, misinterpretations, and factual inaccuracies, introducing significant business risk.
*   **Inconsistent:** The tone, style, and quality of memos vary significantly from person to person and team to team, lacking a unified standard.
*   **Knowledge Silos:** Information from one document is not easily cross-referenced with another, leading to a fragmented understanding of complex topics.

### 3. Our Solution: A Smart Assistant for Financial Professionals

TinyRAG is a secure, internal web platform that acts as a smart assistant for any professional tasked with document analysis and memo creation.

At its core, TinyRAG allows a user to:
1.  **Upload** any set of source documents (PDFs, Word docs, Excel sheets, even images of charts).
2.  **Select** a pre-defined, expert-crafted prompt (e.g., "Generate a risk analysis memo").
3.  **Review and receive** a well-structured, formatted memo in seconds, with every key point transparently linked back to the source material.

This transforms the user's role from a "manual drafter" to a "strategic editor," allowing them to focus their expertise on refining insights rather than on tedious data compilation.

### 4. Target Audience & User Personas

*   **Primary User: The Financial Analyst (e.g., Sarah, Risk Management)**
    *   **Goal:** Quickly understand the key risks and opportunities in quarterly earnings reports and competitor filings to prepare a summary for her director.
    *   **Pain Point:** Spends too much time reading and not enough time analyzing. Worries about missing a critical detail buried on page 73 of a 100-page document.
    *   **How TinyRAG Helps:** Sarah uploads three PDFs. TinyRAG generates a draft in 90 seconds, highlighting the exact sentences related to credit risk and market liquidity, saving her an entire afternoon of work.

*   **Secondary User: The Legal Counsel (e.g., David, Compliance)**
    *   **Goal:** Review new regulatory documents and summarize their impact on current business practices.
    *   **Pain Point:** Needs absolute factual accuracy and traceability for every claim made in his summaries.
    *   **How TinyRAG Helps:** David uses TinyRAG to generate a summary. He relies on the built-in citations to instantly verify that the AI's output is faithful to the original legal text, ensuring compliance and reducing legal risk.

*   **Power User: The Prompt Engineer (e.g., Admin Team)**
    *   **Goal:** Create and refine the standard prompt templates used across the organization to ensure high-quality, consistent outputs.
    *   **Pain Point:** Lacks a systematic way to test and improve prompts.
    *   **How TinyRAG Helps:** The "Prompt Studio" provides a playground to test new prompts against a golden dataset, with dashboards showing which prompts yield the most accurate and helpful results.

2.  **Quality & Trust:**
    *   **Metric:** Average user feedback score (Target: 4.5/5 stars or higher).
    *   **Metric:** Percentage of generated memos that are used with "minor edits" vs. "major rewrites" (tracked via user survey).

3.  **Adoption Rate:**
    *   **Metric:** Monthly Active Users (MAU) (Target: 200 active users by end of Phase 2).
    *   **Metric:** Number of teams onboarded onto the platform.
